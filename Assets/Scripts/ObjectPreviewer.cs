/// ObjectPreviewer by Nothke
/// 
/// Directly draws a GameObject for preview without any object cloning.
/// Used for example when you want to preview the "build" location in RTS games.
/// 
/// How to use:
/// 
/// 1. Call ObjectPreviewer.SetObject() once, when you switch objects
/// 2. Call ObjectPreviewer.Render() every frame you want your previously set
/// object to be rendered.
